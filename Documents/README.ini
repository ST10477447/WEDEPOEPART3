How to View the Website:
1. **Extract the ZIP file** to a location on your computer.
2. Open the extracted folder.
3. Double-click `Home page` to launch the homepage in your browser.
4. Navigate through the site using links provided on each page.

Important Notes:
- Do **not** run the site directly from inside the ZIP file. Always extract first.
- Make sure the folder structure remains intact after extraction.
- If styles, scripts, or images do not load, check that the paths in your HTML files match the folder names exactly (case-sensitive).

Accessibility:
- All images include `alt` text for screen readers.
- Navigation and content are structured for clarity and usability.

Troubleshooting:
- If links or assets are broken, confirm that:
  - The ZIP was fully extracted.
  - You are opening `index.html` from the correct folder.
  - File paths in HTML match the actual folder structure.
